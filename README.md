# Simple Web Forum
This website is a personal project built for the **CVWO winter assignment** 2024

## Tech Stack
The tech stack used is largely based on the specifications of the assignment, with a few personal choices made to enhance features and simplify build process.

### Frontend
The frontend of the website is built using the following
1. React with Vite
2. TypeScript
3. Tailwind CSS

I have opted for Tailwind CSS instead of component libraries such as Material UI to ensure that the app is lightweight, customizable, consistent and to speed up the development cycle.
